This repository is a pytorch implementation of a learning framework for implementing different models for the neural abstractive text summarization and beyond. 
It is an extension of [NATS](https://github.com/tshi04/NATS) toolkit, which is a toolkit for Neural Abstractive Text Summarization. 
The goal of this framework is to make it convinient to try out new ideas in abstractive text summarization and other language generation tasks.

## Requirements

- glob
- argparse
- shutil
- spacy
- pytorch 1.0

## Usuage

#### Scripts

- [Set up GPU, cuda and pytorch](https://github.com/tshi04/LeafNATS/tree/master/LeafNATS/tools/config_server)
- [Install pyrouge and ROUGE-1.5.5](https://github.com/tshi04/LeafNATS/tree/master/LeafNATS/tools/rouge_package)

#### Dataset

In this survey, we run an extensive set of experiments with NATS on the following datasets. Here, we provide the link to CNN/Daily Mail dataset and data processing codes for Newsroom and Bytecup2018 datasets. The preprocess data will be available upon request.
- [CNN/Daily Mail](https://github.com/abisee/pointer-generator)
- [Newsroom](https://github.com/tshi04/LeafNATS/tree/master/LeafNATS/tools/newsroom_process)
- [Bytecup2018](https://github.com/tshi04/LeafNATS/tree/master/LeafNATS/tools/bytecup_process)

In the dataset, \<s\> and \</s\> is used to separate sentences. \<sec\> is used to separate summaries and articles. We did not use the json format because it takes more space and be difficult to transfer between servers.

#### Examples

LeafNATS is current under development. A simple way to run models that have already implemented is
- ```Check:``` Go to [examples](https://github.com/tshi04/LeafNATS/tree/master/LeafNATS/examples) to check models we have implemented.

- ```Import``` In run.py, import the example you want to try.

- ```Training:``` python run.py 

- ```Validate:``` python run.py --task validate

- ```Test:``` python run.py --task beam

- ```Rouge:``` python run.py --task rouge
