This repository is a pytorch implementation of a training framework of seq2seq models for the neural abstractive text summarization and beyond. It is an extension of [NATS](https://github.com/tshi04/NATS) which is a toolkit for Neural Abstractive Text Summarization. The goal of this framework is to make it convinient to try out new ideas in text summarization and other language generation models.
